# SortMyFiles
CMPT 275 Term Project
Video demonstration: https://youtu.be/-RJURvPQ3DU
This program allows for easy manipulation of files and directories as well as a custom tagging feature. 
The tagging feature allows the user to add a custom tag to any number of files which is stored in a database.
When those files are moved via the software it will update the location of the tagged file.

The database file will be created in the same directory as the code.
To run the source or jar it will require JDK 15 or newer.
